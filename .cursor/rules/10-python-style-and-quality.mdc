- Target Python 3.11. Use 4-space indentation, `snake_case`, and type hints for new/changed functions.
- Prefer small, testable functions with clear IO contracts; add short docstrings noting inputs, side effects, and outputs.
- When you change Python code, run formatting/linting expectations consistent with the repo (e.g. `ruff format` / `ruff check` when available).
- Avoid hidden global state; keep stage parameters in a single dataclass/config object when appropriate.
