- Commit messages: concise, imperative, and scoped (e.g. `lidar: ...`, `thermal: ...`, `fusion: ...`, `docs: ...`).
- If harvesting/importing is involved, include provenance notes (legacy source path + SHA256) in the PR/commit body and ensure manifest entries exist.
- Don’t mix unrelated refactors with behavior changes; keep diffs reviewable.
