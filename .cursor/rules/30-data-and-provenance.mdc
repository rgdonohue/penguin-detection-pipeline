- Do not commit large binary data or harvested artifacts. Track provenance via `manifests/harvest_manifest.csv` instead.
- If a script produces a new on-disk artifact intended to be kept, place it under `data/interim/` (temporary) or `data/processed/` (blessed outputs) and document the path + purpose.
- Treat credentials/tokens as forbidden; never add secrets to repo or logs.
- If you introduce new outputs, keep filenames and schemas stable and update any downstream readers/tests.
