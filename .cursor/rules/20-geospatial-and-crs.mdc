- Default CRS for Argentina outputs is **EPSG:32720** (UTM 20S). Always label CRS explicitly and keep units consistent.
- Never silently mix pixel coordinates with projected coordinates. If converting between pixel↔CRS, document the transform and validate with a small numeric sanity check.
- Spatial joins must be CRS-aware; reproject explicitly before nearest-neighbor or distance calculations.
- Prefer stable sorting before writing outputs so file diffs are deterministic.
