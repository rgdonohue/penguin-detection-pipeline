# Wildlife Observer Checklist and Reaction Log

**Mission Date**: ________________
**Observer Name**: ________________
**Location**: ________________
**Weather Conditions**: ________________

**Sensor Priority Reminder**: LiDAR quality comes first (primary detection). Thermal imagery is secondary for validation; never compromise wildlife welfare or LiDAR parameters to optimise thermal contrast.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

- [ ] Wildlife disturbance permits verified and on-hand
- [ ] Emergency abort procedures reviewed with pilot
- [ ] Observation position established (clear view of colony)
- [ ] Binoculars/spotting scope ready
- [ ] Recording equipment (video/photo) ready for documentation
- [ ] Baseline behavior documented before drone launch
- [ ] Wind speed and direction noted

## Altitude Testing Protocol

### Flight 1: 70m AGL
**Time**: ________
**Point Density Achieved**: ________ pts/m²
**Duration Over Colony**: ________ minutes

**Behavioral Observations**:
- [ ] No visible response
- [ ] Head raising/alertness
- [ ] Vocalizations
- [ ] Movement within colony
- [ ] Birds leaving nests
- [ ] Other: ________________

**Decision**:
- [ ] Point density adequate - continue at 70m
- [ ] Point density insufficient - request 60m test
- [ ] Abort due to disturbance

**Notes**: ________________________________________________

**Duration Over Colony**: ________ minutes

**Behavioral Observations**:
- [ ] No visible response
- [ ] Head raising/alertness
- [ ] Vocalizations
- [ ] Movement within colony
- [ ] Birds leaving nests
- [ ] Other: ________________

**Decision**:
- [ ] Point density adequate - continue at 60m

### Flight 4: 40m AGL (maximum monitoring - only with explicit approval)
**Written approval obtained from**: ________________
**Approval document reference**: ________________
**Time**: ________
**Point Density Achieved**: ________ pts/m²

**CONTINUOUS MONITORING REQUIRED**

**Behavioral Observations** (document every 2 minutes):

| Time | Behavior Observed | % Colony Affected | Action Taken |
|------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Abort Triggers** (immediate landing if observed):
- [ ] >10% of birds leaving nests
- [ ] Any chick abandonment
- [ ] Stampede/panic behavior
- [ ] Predator attraction to disturbed area

**Post-Flight Colony Status**:
- [ ] Colony returned to normal within 5 minutes
- [ ] Colony returned to normal within 10 minutes
- [ ] Persistent disturbance after 10 minutes
- [ ] Required intervention: ________________

## General Observations

### Response Severity Scale
**0 - No Response**: Normal behavior continues
**1 - Alert**: Head raising, increased vigilance (<25% of colony)
**2 - Mild Disturbance**: Some vocalizations, minor movement (25-50% of colony)
**3 - Moderate Disturbance**: Widespread alertness, movement within colony (>50%)
**4 - Strong Disturbance**: Birds leaving nests, defensive postures
**5 - Severe Disturbance**: Panic, abandonment, stampede

**Maximum Response Level Observed**: ________

### Environmental Factors Affecting Response
- [ ] Time of day: Morning / Midday / Afternoon / Evening
- [ ] Breeding stage: Courtship / Incubation / Chick-rearing / Fledging
- [ ] Weather: Calm / Windy / Overcast / Sunny
- [ ] Colony density: Sparse / Moderate / Dense
- [ ] Previous exposure to drones: Yes / No / Unknown
